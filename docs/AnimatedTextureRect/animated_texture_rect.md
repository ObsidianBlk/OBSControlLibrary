<h1>AnimatedTextureRect Documentation</h1>

The *AnimatedTextureRect* control is a union of the *AnimatedSprite2D* and *TextureRect* nodes. *AnimatedTextureRect* utilizes a SpriteFrames resource object to define it's texture(s) and animation and if configured in very much the same way as the built in *AnimatedSprite2D* node. Similarly, the *AnimatedTextureRect* node is scaled, positioned, and using the same properties as *TextureRect*.

*(more to come)*
